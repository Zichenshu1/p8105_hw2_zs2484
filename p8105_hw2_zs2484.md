## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

``` r
precip_2018 =
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

``` r
precip_2017 =
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

precip_df2 = 
  left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains indormation from the Mr. Trash Wheel collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel
collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains
information on year, month, and trash collected, include some specific
kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final dataset.
Additional data sheets include month precipitation data.

The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8

The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

##### Read in the subway dataset.

``` r
subway_df = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, route1:route11, station_latitude, station_longitude, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = "TRUE", "NO" = "FALSE"), entry = as.logical(entry))
```

The dataset contains these **line, station\_name, route1, route2,
route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10,
route11, station\_latitude, station\_longitude, entry, vending,
entrance\_type, ada** variables. It consists of **1868** rows and **19**
columns. Some of the cleaning steps I have done so far are converting
all variable names to lower case and replace the space with underscore,
select the required variables and change the “entry” variable to a
logical variable. The data is not tidy since the dataset is in “wider”
format and route8:11 are double variable.

``` r
distinct_station = distinct(subway_df, station_name, line, .keep_all = T)

ada_compliance = filter(distinct_station, ada == TRUE)
  

no_vending = filter(subway_df, vending == "NO")
  
entry_no_vending = filter(no_vending, entry == TRUE)
```

There are distinct **465** stations. There are **84** stations with ada
compliance. The proportion of station entrances without vending allow
entrance is **0.3770492**

##### Reformat the route number and route name

``` r
subway_tidy = 
  mutate(subway_df, route8 = as.character(route8), route9 = as.character(route9), route10 = as.character(route10), route11 = as.character(route11)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(route1:route11, names_to = "route_name", values_to = "route_number") %>% 
  relocate(line, station_name, route_name, route_number)

train_A = 
  distinct(subway_tidy, station_name, line, .keep_all = T) %>% 
  filter(route_number == "A")

train_A_ada = 
  distinct(subway_tidy, station_name, line, .keep_all = T) %>%  
  filter(route_number == "A") %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE)
```

There are **60** distinct stations serves the A train. Of the stations
that serve the A train, **17** are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

##### pols-month.csv dataset

``` r
pols_df = 
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  separate(mon, c("year", "month", "day")) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.double(month), month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
  mutate(president = case_when(prez_gop == "1" ~ "gop", prez_dem == "1" ~ "dem")) %>% 
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

##### snp.csv dataset

``` r
snp_df =
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(date, c("month", "day", "year")) %>%
  mutate(month = as.double(month), month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  relocate(year, month)
```

##### unemployment\_rate.csv dataset

``` r
unemployment_df =
  read_csv("./data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, names_to = "month", values_to = "unemployment_rate") %>%   janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

##### Merging snp\_df into pols\_df, then merge unemployment\_df

``` r
pols_snp_df = left_join(pols_df, snp_df, by = c("year" = "year", "month" = "month"))

pols_snp_employment_df = left_join(pols_snp_df, unemployment_df, by = c("year" = "year", "month" = "month"))
```

The pols-month.csv dataset contains **year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop,
rep\_gop, gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president** variables. The
snp.csv dataset contains **year, month, gov\_gop, sen\_gop, rep\_gop,
gov\_dem, sen\_dem, rep\_dem, president** variables. The
unemployment.csv dataset contains **year, month, unemployment\_rate**
variables. The resulting dataset has **822** rows and **11** columnscx.
The range of year is **1947, 2015**. The final dataset is joined by the
common keys variables: **year** and **month**.
