## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

``` r
precip_2018 =
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

``` r
precip_2017 =
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

precip_df2 = 
  left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains indormation from the Mr. Trash Wheel collector in
Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel
collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains
information on year, month, and trash collected, include some specific
kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final dataset.
Additional data sheets include month precipitation data.

The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8

The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

``` r
subway_df = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, route1:route11, station_latitude, station_longitude, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = "TRUE", "NO" = "FALSE"), entry = as.logical(entry))
```

The dataset contains these **line, station\_name, route1, route2,
route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10,
route11, station\_latitude, station\_longitude, entry, vending,
entrance\_type, ada** variables. It consists of **1868** rows and **19**
columns. Some of the cleaning steps I have done so far are converting
all variable names to lower case and replace the space to underscore,
select the required variables and change the “entry” variable to a
logical variable.

``` r
distinct_station = distinct(subway_df, station_name)

ada_compliance = filter(subway_df, ada == TRUE)

entry = select(subway_df, entry)
entry_novending = filter(entry, entry == FALSE)
```

There are distinct **356** stations. There are **468** stations with ada
compliance. The proportion of station entrances without vending allow
entrance is **0.0615632**
